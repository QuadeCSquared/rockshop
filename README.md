# rockshop app
## Project Details
This is proof-of-concept project for a Express/Node/Javascript stack using postgresql as a backend database to store inventory information for Moon Mountain Gems or some other generic rockshop or even any inventory that has both per piece and by weight items.
### Current Features
- Web based interface
- Inventory Page
- Add New Entry Page
- Sortable By KG, By Piece, Combined, and Sold item tables
- Logging Page and Function
- Postgres Database with a Receipts and Log tables
- Docker Wrapper, for easy compatibility and demo of the system.
### Explanation
This is a forked version of the original repository for the rockshop app, due to me working on the app seperately from Hector, who developed very interesting imaging processes that I was unable to continue developing in my fork of the project. I have not been in contact with Kevin Hedmans, but I still want to acknowledge his original contributions.
