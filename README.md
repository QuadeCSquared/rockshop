# rockshop app
## Project Details
This is proof-of-concept project for a Express/Node/Javascript stack using postgresql as a backend database to store inventory information for Moon Mountain Gems or some other generic rockshop or even any inventory that has both per piece and by weight items.

### Current Features
- Web based interface
- Inventory Page
- Add New Entry Page
- Sortable By KG, By Piece, Combined, and Sold item tables
- Logging Page and Function
- Postgres Database with a Receipts and Log tables
- Docker Wrapper, for easy compatibility and demo of the system.

### Explanation
This is a forked version of the original repository for the rockshop app, due to me working on the app seperately from Hector, who developed very interesting imaging processes that I was unable to continue developing in my fork of the project, so I removed the files unconnected to my body of work. I have not been able to contact Kevin Hedmans, but I still want to acknowledge his original contributions and ideas.

## Credits
The current project was developed by me using tools such as the Internet and ChatGPT. There are some vestigial contributions from the orignal repository, but a lot of this code has been refactored and rewritten. However, I want to give what credit I can to the contributions of others.
### Feature Idea Credits
- Inventory Page Search Functionality. A fair bit of the orignal code from this comes from Kevin's Contributions before the fork, so I want to acknowledge that here.
- Uploads.js. While rewritten in some part, part of this can be traced back to Hector's Contributions.

## Original Repository Credits (Before Fork)
This is an acknowledgement that there was work done as a group before communication issues forced me to fork the project into my own.
